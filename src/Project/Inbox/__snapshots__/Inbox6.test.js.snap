          Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting this week, an update to the dynamic class scheduler will improve access to safe, in-person class participation for those who want it. The change will be effective with assignments for the week of November 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Sunday prior to the week of class, any students who are not compliant with their required COVID-19 testing cadence are removed from in-person assignments. Beginning tomorrow, the dynamic scheduler will fill those seats emptied due to testing non-compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you indicate an in-person preference but receive a remote assignment on Thursday, please check back each Sunday evening to see if your assignment has been updated to in-person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The university remains committed to providing as many in-person learning opportunities as possible, whenever it is safe to do so. If you have any questions, please visit the Dynamic Scheduling page.
