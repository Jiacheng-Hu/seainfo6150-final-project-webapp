          Dear student,
        </p>
        <p>
          According to OGS records, your I-20 will expire at the end of the Spring/Winter 2021 term.  As you should have seen in previous communications from Northeastern, the Spring/Winter 2021 academic calendar has been adjusted to promote the health and wellbeing of the Northeastern community. Due to these adjustments, your I-20 end date will be updated in SEVIS to match the academic calendar. A new I-20 will not be issued and is not required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please refer to the University Academic Calendar determine your new program end date. Your program end date can be found on page 1 of your I-20 in the “Program of Study” section.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMPORTANT: If your I-20 is expiring at the end of the Spring/Winter 2021 term, but you are NOT completing your program, you are required to submit a program extension request. Failure to submit a program extension request prior to your current program end date will result in the automatic completion of your SEVIS record and failure to maintain status and/or loss of benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you will be applying for Post-Completion OPT, please apply based on your new I-20 program end date. When your Post-OPT Recommendation I-20 is printed, this I-20 will reflect your updated program end date. More information about how and when to apply for Post-OPT can be found here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have additional concerns, please respond to this email, or call OGS at 617-373-2310.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
